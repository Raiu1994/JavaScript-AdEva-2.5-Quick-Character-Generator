# JavaScript-AdEva-2.5-Quick-Character-Generator
Creating characters the old fashioned way is a slow process, so I'm writing this program to cut down the amount of time needed to make a character for an RPG. The RPG for this program is the game Adeptus Evangelion, 2.5 Edition.

Version 0.1: Added Javascript program, drawn from https://www.developphp.com/video/JavaScript/Dice-Roll-Programming-Tutorial-For-Web-Browser-Games which will be used as the starting point for this program. This will also help me reinforce some of the tricks of Javascript that I need to be familiar with in the future.
